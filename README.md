Functional interface - an interface with a single abstract method.

Comparable and comparator interface are both functional interfaces.

Lambda expression - anonymous function we can pass around.

Lamdda expressions are essentially objects that can be used to represent anonymous functions.

In lambda expressions, the keyword this references the enclosing object whereas in anonymous inner classes, this 
references the current instance of the anonymous inner class and other difference between these two
types is that the anonymous inner classes can have state so, they can have field to store some data in. 
In lambda expressions we cannot have fields.
